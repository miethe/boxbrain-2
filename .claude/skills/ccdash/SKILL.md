description: Answer CCDash project-intelligence questions using the shipped MCP tools when available and the in-repo `ccdash` CLI otherwise. Use when the operator or another agent asks about project status, feature forensics, workflow failure patterns, after-action reports, session intelligence (transcripts, search, detail), runtime validation posture, CLI timeout or caching behavior, container project onboarding, watcher binding, or how to troubleshoot the shipped CCDash API/worker/MCP surfaces. Keep routing aligned with the current shipped runtime contract and repo docs.

# ccdash Skill

Route CCDash questions to the shipped agent-facing surfaces that exist in this repo today:

- MCP stdio server via [`.mcp.json`](/Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/CCDash/.mcp.json)
- In-repo `ccdash` CLI (`status`, `feature`, `workflow`, `report`)
- Standalone CLI (`ccdash-cli` package, HTTP transport to remote server)
- Runtime-validation docs for API health and worker probes

The business logic is transport-neutral. CLI and MCP are adapters over `backend/application/services/agent_queries/`.

## When To Use

Trigger on intents such as:

- "What's the state of this project?" / "project status" / "project summary"
- "Why did FEAT-X take so long?" / "retrospective on FEAT-X" / "AAR for FEAT-X"
- "Which workflows are failing?" / "failure burden" / "workflow diagnostics"
- "Show me the feature forensics for FEAT-X" / "list features matching X"
- "Is the hosted runtime healthy?" / "how do I validate API vs worker?" / "which probe should I hit?"
- "Is the MCP server shipped here?" / "should I use MCP or CLI for this?"
- "Why is my CLI timing out?" / "results look stale"
- "Prepare this project for the container stack" / "generate watcher env" / "bind worker-watch to a project"

## When NOT To Use

- General coding tasks unrelated to CCDash observability or runtime posture.
- Inventing runtime behaviors that contradict the split API/worker contract.

## Confidence Anchor

Repo-verified current surfaces:

**In-repo CLI groups** (`backend/.venv/bin/ccdash`):
- `ccdash status project`
- `ccdash feature report <feature_id>`
- `ccdash feature list [--q TEXT] [--status STATUS]`
- `ccdash workflow failures`
- `ccdash report aar --feature <feature_id>`
- `ccdash session search <query> [--project PROJECT] [--feature FEATURE] [--limit N]`
- `ccdash session get <session_id> --project <project_id> [--include SEG]... [--cursor CUR] [--limit N]`
- `ccdash session transcript <session_id> --project <project_id> [--cursor CUR] [--limit N]`

Global flags (all commands): `--timeout N`, `--no-cache`, `--json`, `--md`

**MCP tools**: `ccdash_project_status`, `ccdash_feature_forensics`, `ccdash_workflow_failure_patterns`, `ccdash_generate_aar`, `ccdash_session_search`, `ccdash_session_detail`, `ccdash_session_transcript`

**Runtime entrypoints**: hosted API via `backend.runtime.bootstrap_api:app`; worker via `python -m backend.worker`

## Session Intelligence (Phase 3 — Transport-Neutral)

The session surfaces (MCP, repo-CLI, standalone-CLI, REST) are all backed by the same
transport-neutral Phase 1 service at
`backend/application/services/agent_queries/session_detail.py`.

### MCP tools

| Tool | Parameters | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ccdash_session_search` | `project_id` (required), `query` (required, min 2 chars), `feature_id`, `limit` (max 100), `offset` | Full-text / semantic search across session transcripts |
| `ccdash_session_detail` | `project_id` (required), `session_id` (required), `include[]`, `cursor`, `limit` (max 200) | Full detail bundle with transcript, tokens, subagents, artifacts, links |
| `ccdash_session_transcript` | `project_id` (required), `session_id` (required), `cursor`, `limit` (max 200) | Cursor-paginated transcript page only |

**`project_id` is required for all three tools.** Missing project_id → structured `status: "error"` response.
Unknown session_id → `status: "not_found"`.  Empty optional segments → empty list (not an error).

### MCP Payload Budget (T3-004)

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT_LIMIT` | 50 items | Default page size for MCP tool calls |
| `MCP_TRANSCRIPT_MAX_LIMIT` | 200 items | Per-call hard ceiling (below service max of 1 000) |
| `MCP_ENVELOPE_MAX_BYTES` | 1 048 576 (1 MiB) | Hard byte ceiling for MCP stdio envelopes |

When the serialised response exceeds `MCP_ENVELOPE_MAX_BYTES`, transcript items are trimmed
from the tail and the response metadata carries:
- `meta.truncated: true`
- `meta.truncated_reason` with cursor guidance
- `meta.payload_bytes` with the final byte count

Use `data.transcript.nextCursor` to retrieve the next page of a truncated transcript.

### Repo-CLI session commands

```bash
# Search sessions (defaults to active project if --project omitted)
ccdash session search "authentication flow" --json
ccdash session search "timeout" --project proj-abc --feature FEAT-123 --limit 10

# Full detail (--project required, no active-project fallback)
ccdash session get sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --json
ccdash session get sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --include transcript --include tokens

# Paginated transcript
ccdash session transcript sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --limit 50 --json
# Use nextCursor from previous output:
ccdash session transcript sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --cursor <opaque> --json
```

### Standalone CLI (ccdash-cli, HTTP transport)

```bash
# Transcript-bearing detail (Phase 2 REST endpoint, --project required)
ccdash session get sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --json
ccdash session get sess-abc123 --project proj-abc --include transcript --include tokens

# Existing commands (unchanged)
ccdash session list --feature FEAT-123
ccdash session search "authentication"
ccdash session show sess-abc123   # legacy endpoint, no transcript
```

### Redaction note

All transcript payloads are redacted by the Phase 1 service **before** egress.
Every transport (MCP, CLI, REST) inherits the same secret-scrubbing guarantee automatically.
Layer 1 (pattern scan: API keys, AWS/GCP creds, bearer tokens) and Layer 2 (tool-name-aware
field scan) are both applied.  `redactedFieldCount` in the response indicates how many fields
were redacted.

### project_id usage note

The `project_id` parameter is **the owning project** of the session, not the currently active
project.  This enables cross-project session forensics without switching the active project.
All three transports enforce this invariant — there is no silent active-project fallback.

## Routing Posture

Use the following transport order:

1. **Prefer MCP for in-workspace agent reasoning** when the repo `.mcp.json` is present and the question maps cleanly to one of the four shipped tools. This avoids shelling out and matches the current Claude Code posture.
2. **Use the in-repo CLI as the fallback adapter** when MCP is unavailable, when you need explicit output modes, or when validating parity against the command surface.
3. **Use the standalone CLI** when the user is operating against a remote CCDash server rather than local data. See [Standalone CLI vs In-Repo CLI](#standalone-cli-vs-in-repo-cli) below.
4. **Use runtime docs and HTTP probes for deployment/runtime troubleshooting.** Do not invent CLI transport-management commands that are not shipped.

Current shipped posture: MCP is discoverable, but not the only path. CLI remains valid. Runtime validation is a separate concern handled through the API/worker contract.

## Standalone CLI vs In-Repo CLI

| Dimension | In-Repo CLI | Standalone CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `backend/.venv/bin/ccdash` | `pipx install ccdash-cli` → `ccdash` |
| Transport | Local data / lightweight bootstrap | HTTP to remote CCDash server (`/api/v1/`) |
| Auth | None | Bearer token via OS keyring or `CCDASH_TOKEN` |
| Config | None | `~/.config/ccdash/config.toml` (named targets) |
| Command groups | `status`, `feature`, `workflow`, `report` | All in-repo groups + `session`, `target`, `doctor`, `diagnostics`, `version` |
| Use when | Querying local project data | Operating against hosted/remote server |

**Do not** suggest `target`, `doctor`, `target login`, or `session` commands to a user running only the in-repo CLI.

## Query Caching

All four query services (project-status, feature-forensics, workflow-diagnostics, aar-report) use an in-process TTL cache:

| Config | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CCDASH_QUERY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | 60 | Cache lifetime; set to 0 to disable |
| `CCDASH_QUERY_CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | 300 | Background warming interval; 0 disables |
| `--no-cache` CLI flag | off | Force cache miss for one invocation |
| `bypass_cache=true` query param | off | Force cache miss via HTTP |

**Guidance**: Use `--no-cache` when debugging stale data. Do not disable the cache in production — background warming reduces cold-path latency. OpenTelemetry counters are emitted per cache event.

## CLI Timeout

The standalone CLI exposes a global timeout on every command:

| Config | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--timeout N` flag | 30s | Precedence: flag > env > default |
| `CCDASH_TIMEOUT` env var | 30s | Applied when flag is absent |

Commands that can be slow on large projects: `status project`, `report aar`, `workflow failures`. Consider `--timeout 60` or higher when these time out. See `/Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/CCDash/docs/guides/cli-timeout-debugging.md` for diagnosis patterns.

## Routing Table

| Intent | Preferred MCP Tool | CLI Fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project status | `ccdash_project_status` | `ccdash status project` | Use MCP first for agent reasoning; CLI `--json`/`--md` modes useful |
| Feature forensics | `ccdash_feature_forensics` | `ccdash feature report FEATURE_ID` | Top-level `name`, `status`, `telemetry_available`, `sessions_note` fields available |
| Feature listing | `ccdash_feature_forensics` (list mode) | `ccdash feature list [--q TEXT]` | Paginated; max 200 results; `truncated`/`total` in response |
| Workflow failures | `ccdash_workflow_failure_patterns` | `ccdash workflow failures` | Same query service behind both surfaces |
| AAR / retrospective | `ccdash_generate_aar` | `ccdash report aar --feature FEATURE_ID` | Render markdown/human output as requested |
| Session transcript search | `ccdash_session_search` | `ccdash session search <query> --project P` | project_id required for MCP; optional (active-project fallback) for CLI |
| Session full detail | `ccdash_session_detail` | `ccdash session get ID --project P` | project_id required; transcript cursor-paginated; redaction auto-applied |
| Session transcript page | `ccdash_session_transcript` | `ccdash session transcript ID --project P` | Cursor pagination; use nextCursor for subsequent pages |
| Runtime validation | none | none | Route to `/api/health`, worker probes, and runbook docs |
| MCP setup/troubleshooting | shipped stdio server | CLI parity checks only | Follow `docs/guides/mcp-setup-guide.md` and `docs/guides/mcp-troubleshooting.md` |

## Runtime Contract

Hosted validation assumes a split runtime:

- API runtime serves HTTP and canonical reads.
- Worker runtime owns sync, refresh, and scheduled jobs.
- `local` is a convenience runtime and is not the hosted validation posture.
- `test` is for lightweight CLI/MCP bootstrap and automated coverage.

Canonical hosted entrypoints:

```bash
backend/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn backend.runtime.bootstrap_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
backend/.venv/bin/python -m backend.worker
```

Local helpers like `npm run dev:backend` and `npm run start:worker` are wrappers around the same contract; the bootstrap modules are the canonical reference.

**Containerized deployment**: Docker/Podman compose profiles (`local`, `enterprise`, `postgres`, `live-watch`) are supported. Rootless Podman is supported. Single-command deployment via `docker compose` or `podman-compose`. Reference: `/Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/CCDash/docs/guides/containerized-deployment-quickstart.md`.

**Project onboarding and watcher binding**: container roles resolve projects from mounted `projects.json`. Use `/Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/CCDash/backend/scripts/container_project_onboarding.py` to prepare the registry entry and optional per-watcher env overlay. In v1, `worker-watch` binds one project at startup via `CCDASH_WORKER_WATCH_PROJECT_ID`; UI project switching, standalone CLI `--project`, and target defaults do not rebind a running watcher.

## Probe Semantics

- `GET /api/health` — primary API/runtime contract check.
- Worker probe: `CCDASH_WORKER_PROBE_HOST:CCDASH_WORKER_PROBE_PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:9465`).
  - `/livez` — basic process liveness
  - `/readyz` — readiness after worker binding contract is satisfied
  - `/detailz` — backlog/freshness detail and worker posture

A healthy API does not prove worker ownership is functioning; a ready worker does not replace the API health contract.

## Lightweight Bootstrap Invariant

CLI and MCP use lightweight `test`-profile bootstrap paths. They do not stand up the full hosted runtime and do not own background jobs.

- CLI bootstrap: `backend/cli/runtime.py`
- MCP bootstrap: `backend/mcp/bootstrap.py`
- MCP transport: stdio via [`.mcp.json`](/Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/CCDash/.mcp.json)

Do not claim that CLI or MCP validates the hosted deployment by themselves.

## Output Guidance

- For agent reasoning: prefer structured MCP responses or CLI `--json`.
- For user-facing narrative deliverables: use CLI `--md` where available, especially `report aar`.
- For runtime validation: summarize relevant health/probe fields rather than dumping the entire payload unless the user asks for raw output.

## Multi-Step Flows (Recipes)

- `recipes/feature-retrospective.md` — feature forensics + AAR with MCP-first/CLI-fallback posture.
- `recipes/task-attribution.md` — infer work ownership from feature forensics and evidence rather than stale task/session commands.
- `recipes/unreachable-server.md` — troubleshoot the API/worker/MCP runtime contract and probe semantics.
- `recipes/container-project-onboarding.md` — prepare `projects.json`, generate watcher env overlays, and validate container project visibility without implying remote watcher orchestration.

Prefer a recipe whenever the user's question spans transport choice plus interpretation.

## Do Not Say

- "MCP is deferred until a later phase."
- "Use `ccdash doctor` / `ccdash target show` / `ccdash target login`." (standalone CLI only — not available in the in-repo CLI)
- "Hosted validation should run against `backend.main:app` or `npm run dev`."
- "CLI or MCP starts the full runtime or proves worker ownership on its own."
- "The CLI has no timeout configuration." (it does: `--timeout` flag and `CCDASH_TIMEOUT` env var)
- "Session transcript search is only available in the standalone CLI." (Phase 3: in-repo CLI also has `ccdash session search/get/transcript`)
- "There is no active-project fallback for session get/transcript." (correct — by design; `--project` is required)
- "project_id is optional for session tools." (it is required for both MCP tools and CLI get/transcript)
- "Query results are always fresh." (they are cached; use `--no-cache` to bypass)
- "Changing the active project or CLI target rebinds a running `worker-watch` container."
- "The CCDash API/CLI/skill can remotely scale, start, or rebind watcher containers in the compose examples."
