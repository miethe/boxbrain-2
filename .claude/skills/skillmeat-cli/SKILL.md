  Manage SkillMeat and Claude Code environments through natural language.
  Use this skill for artifact discovery, deployment, management, bundle/scaffold
  operations, memory and context workflows, supply-chain security, versioning,
  authentication, attestation, and enterprise migration.
  Progressive disclosure: load only the workflow doc needed for the current intent.

# SkillMeat CLI Skill

High-level router for SkillMeat agent operations. This file contains only
routing logic and policy. For full capability matrix, invariants, and
enhancement backlog see `./SPEC.md`. For command syntax see canonical user
docs at `docs/user/guides/cli/commands.md` and `docs/user/guides/cli/reference.md`.

## Route Table

| User Intent | Workflow Doc | Canonical CLI Doc |
|---|---|---|
| Find, search, or recommend artifacts | `./workflows/discovery-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Core Commands"`, `§ "Search"` |
| Discover artifacts by intent or context using AI search | `./workflows/discovery-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Discovery"` |
| Deploy, add, or install an artifact to a project | `./workflows/deployment-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Deployment"`, `§ "Adding Artifacts"` |
| List, inspect, sync, update, or remove artifacts | `./workflows/management-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Core Commands"`, `§ "Updates & Status"` |
| Manage deployment sets (create, add-member, deploy, update, delete) | `./workflows/management-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Deployment Sets"` |
| Manage context entities (add, list, show, update, delete, deploy) | `./workflows/management-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Context Entities"` |
| Manage groups (create, list, show, update, delete) | `./workflows/management-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Groups"` |
| Manage composites, MCP artifacts, or workflow artifacts (list/show/update/delete) | `./workflows/management-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Core Commands"` |
| Build a pack from a directory (`bundle build-pack`) and publish, import, export, or deploy a bundle | `./workflows/bundle-workflow.md` | `docs/user/guides/bundle-publish-deploy-guide.md`; `commands.md § "Bundle Management"` |
| Install a marketplace catalog entry (`marketplace install <entry_id> --pin <sha> --conflict-strategy <strategy>`) | `./workflows/bundle-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Marketplace"` |
| Preview a marketplace source import plan (`marketplace sources import preview`) | `./workflows/bundle-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Marketplace"` |

| BOM signing, verification, key management, attestation, pre-commit hooks | `./workflows/supply-chain-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Bundle Signing"`, `§ "SkillBOM"` |
| Link an existing/modified local artifact to a GitHub upstream while keeping your own version as canonical content | `./workflows/upstream-linking-workflow.md` | `commands.md § "Adding Artifacts"`, `§ "Phase 2: Sync Commands"` |

## Policy

### Progressive Disclosure

1. Start from user intent; open only the one workflow doc that matches.
2. Do not load all workflow files by default.
3. Pair the workflow doc with canonical CLI docs for command syntax — never duplicate syntax here.
4. For memory operations: if `skillmeat memory item create` returns 422/400, use the API fallback in `./workflows/memory-context-workflow.md § "API Fallback Procedure"`.

### Permission Protocol

Require explicit confirmation before:
- Deploying or removing artifacts
- Bulk updates, memory extraction apply, or memory merges
- Any destructive BOM or enterprise migration operation

Read-only operations (search, list, show, preview, diagnostics) do not require extra confirmation.

### Route-First Invariant

Prefer canonical user docs over workflow duplication. Workflows exist to cover
agent-specific multi-step patterns and confirmation flows that the user docs do
not address. If the canonical doc covers the intent completely, link to it and
stop — do not re-document command syntax here.

### Enterprise Bundle Guidance (FR-11)

Bundle commands (`export`, `import` direct pack, `add-member`) print actionable
guidance on enterprise edition when unsupported. Always refer users to the
relevant workaround: `skillmeat enterprise import` pre-sync, or the canonical
`bundle publish --from-dir` route. See `docs/user/guides/bundle-publish-deploy-guide.md`
§"Enterprise Edition Guidance" for the complete matrix.
